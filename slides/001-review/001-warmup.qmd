Imagine you randomly select a student from a large class. We're interested in their final course grade. Here's a possible breakdown of how the grades are distributed:

| Grade | Percentage of Students |
|-------|------------------------|
| A     | 20%                    |
| B     | 35%                    |
| C     | 25%                    |
| D     | 15%                    |
| F     | 5%                     |

[Q01.]{.question} If you pick one student at random, what is the probability that the student received at least a B grade?

::: {.answer style="display: inherit;"}

**Probability of at least a B grade:** To get at least a B, the student could have received a B, C, D, or F.  Sum the probabilities of these grades: $35\% + 25\% + 15\% + 5\% = 80\%$

[Q02.]{.question} What is the probability that a randomly chosen student did not receive an A?

::: {.answer style="display: inherit;"}

**Probability of not receiving an A:** This is the opposite (or complement) of getting an A. Since the probabilities must add up to 100%, the probability of not getting an A is $100\% - 20\% = 80\%$
