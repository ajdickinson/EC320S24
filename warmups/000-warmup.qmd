I would like you all to group up. Talk to your peers around you. Discuss the following:

- What is your name?
- How was your spring break?
- What is your major?
- What is your class standing? (e.g., freshman, sophomore, etc.)
- What is econometrics, as you understand it and what do you expect this course is about?

The following two question use the following definition:

[Expected values]{.hi}

> The [expected value]{.hi} $E[X]$ of a [discrete random variable]{.hi} $X$ is defined as:
>  $$
>  E[X] = \sum_{i} x_i P(x_i)
>  $$
>  where $x_i$ are the possible values of $X$, and $P(x_i)$ is the probability that $X$ equals $x_i$. This equation computes the average value of $X$ by weighing each possible value by its probability of occurrence.


## Q01
Suppose we have a [discrete random variable]{.hi} named $A$. The probability distribution for $A$ is:

| Value of $A$ | Probability |
|--------------|-------------|
| -4           | 0.20        |
| 0            | 0.10        |
| 2            | 0.40        |
| 4            | 0.30        |

What would the expected value $E[A]$ be?

The expected value is calculated as follows:

$E[A] = (-4 \cdot 0.20) + (0 \cdot 0.10) + (2 \cdot 0.40) + (4 \cdot 0.30) = 1.2$

Therefore, the expected value E[A] is 1.2

## Q02

Consider the function $g(A) = A^2$, where $A$ is the same random variable as in [Q01]{.hi}. Compute the expected value of $g(A)$. Show the work you use to arrive at your answer.


::: {.answer style="display: inherit;"} 

To find the expected value of g(A), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate g(A) for each value of A:**
   * $g(-4) = (-4)^2 = 16$
   * $g(0) = 0^2 = 0$
   * $g(2) = 2^2 = 4$
   * $g(4) = 4^2 = 16$

2. **Multiply each g(A) value by its corresponding probability:**
   * $16 \cdot 0.20 = 3.2$
   * $0 \cdot 0.10 = 0$
   * $4 \cdot 0.40 = 1.6$
   * $16 \cdot 0.30 = 4.8$

3. **Sum the results:**
   * $3.2 + 0 + 1.6 + 4.8 = 9.6$

Therefore, the expected value of g(A) is 9.6.
